python learned topics and pratices 

ch1: modules, comments and pip
- modules: a module is a file containing code written by 
somebody else (usually) which can be imported and used in our programs. 
- pip: pip is the package manager for puthon you can use pip to install a module on you system
           - pip install flask installs, flask module
- types of modules: there are two types of modules in python
         1. built in modules: pre installed in python
         2. external modules: need to install using pip
             - some examples of build in modules are os, abs, etc...
             - some examples of ecternal modules are tensorflow, flask etc...
ch2: variables and datatypes
a variable is the name given to a memory location in a program for example
a = 30                          --> variables = container to store a value
b = "harry"                     --> keywords = reserved words in python
c = 71.22                       --> identifiers = class/ function/ variable name

data types: primarily these are following data types in python
1. integers
2. floating point numbers
3. string
4. booleans
5. none
python is a fantastic lanuage that automaticallu identifies the type of data for us
a = 71                          --> identifies **a** as class <int>
b = 88.44                       --> identifies **b** as class <float>
name = "harry"                  --> identifies **name** as class <str>

rules for defining a variable name --> also applies to other identifiers
- a variable name contain alphabets, digits and underscores
- a variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscore
- a variable name can't start w/ a digit
- no white space is allowed to be used inside a variablel name
