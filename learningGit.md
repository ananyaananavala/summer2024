github: open-source community where people around the globe work together on open source projects 
and make contributions. 

version control: version control helps, providing you clarify as to when you did it, why you did it
and what the contents of the change were, open for review at any time in the future. 

github shines when we start talking about this in the collaborative sense: you and team members trying
to do the same thing, even worse: on the same or adjecent files. when you do that, you need something 
much more capable than a simple revison history or a single person. you need the idea of keeping track 
of who and when they changed it but, the capability of the tool to unify these back together in what 
typically referred to as a merge. these action, these interleaving of you and the team members working
on the same, similar, or adjacent files is hangeled adeptly by a full-fleged version control system like 
that of git. 

recap: 
- git is a fast and modern implementation of version control
- git provides a history of content changes
- git facilitates collabarative changes to files
- git is easy to use for any type of knowleged worker

some essential things you should be aware of:
- repositories: a GitHub repository can be used to store a development project. it can contain
  folders or any type of files (html, css, javascript, documents, data, images).a gitHub repository
  should also include a license file and a README file about the project.
- branches: a github branch is used to work with different versions of a repository at the same
  time. by default, a repository has a master branch. any other branch is a copy of the master branch.
  new branches are for bug fixes and feature work separate from the master branch. when changes are
  ready, they can be merged into the master branch. if you make changes to the master branch while
  working on a new branch, these updates can be pulled in.
- commits: changes are called commits. each commit has a description of why a change was made.
- pull requests: pull requests are the heart of github collaboration. with a pull request, you are
  proposing that your changes should be merged with the master. Pull requests show content differences,
  changes, additions, and subtractions in colors (green and red).
  as soon as you have a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the
  code is finished.
  a great way to learn GitHub, before working on larger projects, is to open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. 
  you merge any changes into the master by clicking a "merge pull request" button. after merging you can delete the branch by clicking a 
  "delete branch button".
